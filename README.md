#Ruby Netflix Review Analyzer
This was more of an exploring Ruby program, as a result it is command line based. The program basically reads in two text files that contain Netflix reviews of movie data and calculates the top ten rated movies, as well as the top ten users (users with the most reviews). The program then asks the user to enter a movie id and, given a valid id, shows the user the name of the move, average review, number of reviews, and the number of one through five stat ratings.

To run the program place all three files in the same directory and type "ruby NetflixReviewReader.rb" on the command line (make sure you have Ruby installed).

WARNING: The reviews file is kind of big (48 MB) so it may take a while to clone
